		'The Pink and White Terraces, known to the Maori as Te Otukapuarangi and Te Tarata or ‘The Fountain of the Clouded Sky’ and  ‘the Tattooed Rock’ were a set of two spectacular geothermal terraces located on the shores of Lake Rotomahana in New Zealand: one stark white and the other vibrant pink, about a kilometer or so apart. Both were created from silica-rich geothermal springs (and in fact, this is thought to have been the largest silica sinter deposit on Earth), unlike the carbonate travertine structures of Pamukkale and the Mammoth Hot Springs.'),

		'The Pink and White Terraces are thought to have formed due to geothermal springs around a thousand years ago, just barely predating the Māori arrival in New Zealand. It‘s unknown what the Māori thought when they first laid eyes on these magnificent structures (besides perhaps “Choice!”). Regardless, the Māori certainly got to witness the terraces grow and expand as the natural springs fed them with more silica-rich waters. By the time Ferdinand von Hochstetter performed the first European survey of Lake Rotomahana, the larger and hotter White Terraces covered around 20 acres.'),

		'The terraces’ majesty piqued European interest first when Ernst Dieffenbach visited in 1841 and wrote of them. They became a tourist attraction and an enviable posting for young British officers, both for especially wealthy members of society who had to go to the other side of the world for some reason or another. Tourists tended to visit around 11 in the morning, view the White Terraces, have a quick two-hour lunch of potatoes and crayfish, and then bathe in the Pink terraces due to their more comfortable temperature. Having completed washing their rears in what was dubbed the Eighth Wonder of the World, they left, a bucket list item well completed. Fortunately, during the 45-year span of European attention, the terraces were well recorded by amateur photographers and painters. In particular, Charles Bloomfield’s paintings of the terraces are likely the best-known and served most to bolster their popularity.'),

		'Tragically, in 1886, the nearby Mount Tarawera catastrophically erupted. The resulting eruption created a crater so large that it encompassed both terraces and fundamentally changed Lake Rotomahana. This was once thought to have completely destroyed this natural wonder, but in 2011, drone expeditions to the bottom of Rotomahana have rediscovered some parts of some terraces. Whether or not these are the actual Pink and White terraces has been ‘hotly’ debated by geologists since.');
