		"Animals were an important aspect of the Shaman religion in Central Asia. Also known as assistant spirits, guardian spirits, and helping spirits, animal spirits are an integral part of a shaman's work. The more animal spirits a shaman had under his control, the more powerful the shaman. When a shaman set out to journey spiritually to the outer world, animals were a key component, assisting him in his work. There were three primary reasons for a shaman to take such a journey: to find a lost soul, to bring an animal spirit to the high gods, or to lead a soul to its new resting place in the underworld. All of these were extremely important to followers of shamanism and animals were extremely important in facilitating the shaman's efforts."),

		"Ahimsa, less commonly spelled ahinsa, is an ancient Indian principle of nonviolence which applies to all living beings. It is a key virtue in the Dh?rmic religions: Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism and Jainism. Ahimsa is one of the cardinal virtues of Jainism, where it is first of the Pancha Mahavrata. It is also the first of the five precepts of Buddhism. Ahimsa is a multidimensional concept, inspired by the premise that all living beings have the spark of the divine spiritual energy; therefore, to hurt another being is to hurt oneself. While ancient scholars of Hinduism pioneered and refined the principles of ahimsa, the concept also reached an extraordinary development in the ethical philosophy of Jainism. Lord Parsvanatha, the twenty-third tirthankara of Jainism, revived and preached the concept of non-violence in the 9th century BCE. Mahavira, the twenty-fourth and the last tirthankara, further strengthened the idea in the 6th century BCE. Between the 1st century BCE and 5th century CE, Valluvar emphasized ahimsa and moral vegetarianism as virtues for an individual, which formed the core of his teachings. Perhaps the most popular advocate of the principle of ahimsa in the modern times was Mahatma Gandhi.");
