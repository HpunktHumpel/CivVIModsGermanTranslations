The main trading market destination was the German city of Leipzig.Kievan Rus', the first Russian State, was the first supplier of the Russian Fur Trade. European contact with North America, with its vast forests and wildlife, particularly the beaver, led to the continent becoming a major supplier in the 17th century of fur pelts for the fur felt hat and fur trimming and garment trades of Europe. Fur was relied on to make warm clothing, a critical consideration prior to the organization of coal distribution for heating.

		"Par force hunting was the height of fashion for absolutist royalty in the 1600s. The hunt was a grand theatrical event, meticulously planned to demonstrate power and greatness. In Denmark, par force hunting took place in the forests of North Zealand. Par force hunting was introduced in Denmark by Christian V. It originated in France, where Christian V had visited the French court and the Sun King Louis XIV in his youth and become fascinated by the ostentatious hunting style. The King and his distinguished guests participated in the hunt or positioned themselves centrally in the forest while they waited to be summoned. Meanwhile, the mounted hunters and their hounds pursued the day's quarry. In Denmark, this was often a large, majestic stag. From their waiting place, the King and his guests could watch the hunters, horses and hounds as they persecuted the frantic stag at great speed. When the exhausted stag was no longer able to run, the dogs held it fast by biting its throat, ears, legs and muzzle. Thus, the stag was ''fixed'' and the King was summoned with a special horn signal. He carried out his duty as the master of the hunt by killing the stag with a stab wound to the heart. To this end, the King used a spear or a small hunting sword called a hirschfaenger. It was here he could demonstrate his prowess as a great warrior King who dominated nature. However, this undertaking was not without risk. The hunt required precision, strength and, not least, the courage to get close to the stag and deliver the coup de grace. The stag, which could weigh up to 200 kg, may well have been exhausted, but with adrenaline and fear coursing through its body, it was difficult for the hounds to hold on to it. One swipe of its impressive antlers or a hard kick from its hind legs could be fatal. Most often, though, the hunt ended well and the King could show off his triumph before his guests."),

It is a key virtue in the Dh?rmic religions: Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism and Jainism. Ahimsa is one of the cardinal virtues of Jainism, where it is first of the Pancha Mahavrata. It is also the first of the five precepts of Buddhism. Ahimsa is a multidimensional concept, inspired by the premise that all living beings have the spark of the divine spiritual energy; therefore, to hurt another being is to hurt oneself. While ancient scholars of Hinduism pioneered and refined the principles of ahimsa, the concept also reached an extraordinary development in the ethical philosophy of Jainism. Lord Parsvanatha, the twenty-third tirthankara of Jainism, revived and preached the concept of non-violence in the 9th century BCE. Mahavira, the twenty-fourth and the last tirthankara, further strengthened the idea in the 6th century BCE. Between the 1st century BCE and 5th century CE, Valluvar emphasized ahimsa and moral vegetarianism as virtues for an individual, which formed the core of his teachings. Perhaps the most popular advocate of the principle of ahimsa in the modern times was Mahatma Gandhi."),

The type of training an animal receives will vary depending on the training method used, and the purpose for training the animal. For example, a seeing eye dog will be trained to achieve a different goal than a wild animal in a circus. Exotic wild beasts from the far reaches of the Roman Empire were brought to Rome and hunts were held in the morning prior to the afternoon main event of gladiatorial duels. The hunts were held in the Roman Forum, the Saepta, and in the Circus Maximus, though none of these venues offered protection to the crowd from the wild animals on display. Special precautions were taken to prevent the animals from escaping these venues, such as the erection of barriers and the digging of ditches. Very few animals survived these hunts though they did sometimes defeat the ''bestiarius'', or hunter of wild beast. Thousands of wild animals would be slaughtered in one day.

		"Trapping pits are deep pits dug into the ground, or built from stone, in order to trap animals. European rock drawings and cave paintings reveal that red deer (Cervus elaphus) and elk/moose (Alces alces) were hunted since the Stone Age using trapping pits. Remains of trapping pits used for hunting elk, reindeer, wolves, and bears can still be found in Northern Scandinavia. In Norway two forms are found: a tapered construction with a timbered box at the bottom where the legs of the animal are locked, or a bigger one where the animal falls through a covered lid. The latter one will typically have a bowl form today, while the former most often lacks the timbered box. The tapered construction seems to be the most common one, especially in the mountains. Early examples of these trapping devices have been excavated by archaeologists and older sites are questionably dated to around 3700 BC while one of the later ones in Lesja municipality in Gudbrandsdalen is dated to 1690. Another location Rødsmoen at Grafjell was in use over a period of 2000 years, from older Bronze Age around 1800 BC to older Iron Age around 500-550 AD. From the excavations at Dokkfløy it seems that the hunting pits has been in use during two periods, an older period from around 500-300 BC, perhaps still in use around 1000 AD, and a later period up to about 1700 AD.

From earliest times, a smokehouse was a small enclosed shelter, a place in which a fire could be kept smoldering for a few weeks, which would only slowly release its smoke, and in which the smoked meat could hang safe from vermin and thieves. Just about any sort of vernacular shed could serve. But an elegant Gothic one appears in a book of hours painted in France by the so-called Rohan Master about 1420. On the page for December, a pig is being slaughtered, a wooden tub sits ready for the salted meats, and a fire has been kindled in the little smokehouse. Not that all those necessary tasks are meant to happen on the same day. In essence, you cure meat in two steps. The fresh cuts are packed in tubs of coarse salt for about six weeks while the salt draws most of the water from the flesh. Then the salted meats are hung in a tightly constructed wooden shed, usually without windows or a flue, in which a fire smolders for one to two weeks. The result is dried, long-lasting, smoke-flavored meat that will age in the same smokehouse for two years before it's eaten."),

The term was first used in 17th-century France, in reference to the management of household or domestic stock. Later, it came to be used primarily in reference to aristocratic or royal animal collections. The French-language Methodical Encyclopaedia of 1782 defines a menagerie as an establishment of luxury and curiosity. Later on, the term referred also to travelling animal collections that exhibited wild animals at fairs across Europe and the Americas. In the nineteenth century the aristocratic menageries were displaced by the modern zoological gardens with their scientific and educational approach. The last menagerie in Europe was the Tiergarten Schönbrunn in Vienna, which was known officially as a menagerie until 1924, before evolving into a modern zoological garden with a scientific, educational and conservationist orientation. Due to its local continuity, the former menagerie established in the medieval through baroque tradition of private wild-animal collections of princes and kings, is often seen as the oldest remaining zoo in the world. Although many of the old Baroque enclosures have been changed, one can still obtain a good impression of the symmetrical ensemble of the formerly imperial menagerie."),

The so-called ''Big Five'' game animals of Africa - lion, leopard, rhinoceros, elephant, and Cape buffalo - particularly form an important part of the safari market, both for wildlife viewing and big-game hunting. Safari hunting usually employed several hunters for several days to several weeks, involving large numbers of bearers to carry equipment and supplies, gun bearers, game drivers, trackers, and skinners. The safari was led by one or more professional hunters, ''white hunters''. Ultimately, automobiles replaced the bearers for transport, but so intense was the hunting that, by the time air travel made the hunting grounds much more accessible after World War II, some species were hunted to extinction and others nearly so. By the last quarter of the 20th century, safaris were made mainly by tourists who examined and photographed game in national preserves."),

Generally, only some parts of the animal are kept as trophies (usually the head, skin, tusks, horns, or antlers), are mounted by a taxidermist. Trophy hunting as we understand it today can be traced back to the late 19th century. In 1892, a man named Rowland Ward outlined what he called the Horn Measurements and Weights of the Great Game of the World. It was the first official record of trophy hunts. Across the Atlantic, decades later, in 1930, the Boone & Crocket Club, which had been founded by Teddy Roosevelt in 1887, drew up the Boone & Crocket Trophy Scoring System for North American animals.

Increasing the boiling point of the water by adding salts such as calcium chloride made possible a great reduction in the processing time. By 1874 a controllable pressure steam retort had been invented, and between 1920 and 1930 information on the heat resistance of bacterial spores and on heat penetration into cans permitted the preparation of time–temperature processing schedules to control the canning process instead of relying on empiricism. The majority of canned meats are commercially sterilized; that is, they are processed to the point at which all microorganisms and most of their spores have been killed. This permits more or less an indefinite storage life in the can, at ambient temperature, provided it is kept sealed. However, such product is markedly different from freshly cooked meat or pasteurized meat, exhibiting strong cooked flavor and substantially altered physical structures."),

They are the biggest creatures on Earth, and a wrong move can mean a cold death at sea and the right move usually leading to days upon days of endurance and desperation, wearing down the targets. They ultimately learned the best ways to get their toll, going for the ''right'' whales in search of meat, hide, ambergris, and oil. Whaling eventually became so prolific that it nearly drove some species to extinction. The ships of this era were the whaleships, or whalers, which were designed for the hunting of hundreds of whales and the mass processing of their product. Whaling became a very lucrative business, but it's romanticism would remain.

Though there are many radical environmentalist groups, the one most focused towards wildlife emancipation is the Animal Liberation Front. Cells tend to operate secretly much like the associated Earth Liberation Front. The goals? To inflict economic damage on those who profit from animal exploitation, to liberate animals from places of abuse (defined as laboratories, factory farms, fur farms, and zoos), to reveal the horrific acts and atrocities secretly incited against animals, and to do it all without harming any animal or human. Well, maybe.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Though the most used avenue of their work is property crime, comparing the destruction of laboratories and the other listed facilities with destroying Nazi gas chambers, the provisions against violence have been the most internally divisive part of their ethos and have spawned an additional group - the Animal Rights Militia - that ignores this provision.

Candy Bars laced with rat poison, letter bombs sent to all of the major party leads of the UK including Margaret Thatcher, and firebombs around the world represented an escalation of their war against abuse. It is worth noting that - like many terror groups in the modern day - it's unknown if classifying them as a ''group'' is even proper, and it's unknown how much overlap there is between the ALF, the ELF, and the ARM.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Since action began being taken against these groups in the mid 2000s, action has become more rare. ''The Green Scare'' is the byword of critics of the US action (described as ''tentacles'') against these groups."),
