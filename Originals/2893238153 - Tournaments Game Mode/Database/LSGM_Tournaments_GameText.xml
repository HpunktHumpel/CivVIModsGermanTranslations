			<Text>In Edo period Japan, there was a tradition of dueling among the samurai class. In Western society, the formal concept of a duel developed out of the medieval judicial duel and older pre-Christian practices such as the Viking Age holmgang. In medieval society, judicial duels were fought by knights and squires to end various disputes. During the early Renaissance, dueling established the status of a respectable gentleman and was an accepted manner to resolve disputes.</Text>
