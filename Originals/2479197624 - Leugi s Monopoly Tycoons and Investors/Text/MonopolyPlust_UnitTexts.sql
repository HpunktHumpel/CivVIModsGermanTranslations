		"An auditor general, also known in some countries as a comptroller general or comptroller and auditor general, is a senior civil servant charged with improving government accountability by auditing and reporting on the government's operations. Auditing has been a safeguard measure since ancient times, and has since expanded to encompass so many areas in the public and corporate sectors that academics have started identifying a so called Audit Society During medieval times, when manual bookkeeping was prevalent, auditors in Britain used to hear the accounts read out for them and checked that the organization's personnel were not negligent or fraudulent. In 1951, Moyer identified that the most important duty of the auditor was to detect fraud. Chatfield documented that early United States auditing was viewed mainly as verification of bookkeeping detail. A Governor working as an Audit General in your civilization will likely be able to make sure state-owned institutions and corporations lose less money due to corruption, and make sure contracts are fair and not overpriced."),

		"Though the origins of history stretch back beyond the time of Hammurabi, and investment regulations can be marked throughout most histories, the modern concept of investment arose in Amsterdam during the late renaissance. An East Indiaman and her crew were almost universally too expensive and too risky a prospect for a single merchant to bear. However, if the initial investment were spread across many merchants, each of these shares became far more affordable in price, bearable in danger, and tantalizing in opportunity. The titillated merchants of the Dutch East India Company opted to establish a way to sell and trade the shares of these ships in 1602, founding the Amsterdam Stock exchange"),

		"Though now there are far more stock exchanges around the world (with the preeminent ones being Tokyo, London, and especially New York), and the rules have been elaborated upon, they bear great resemblance with their Amsterdammer ancestor, albeit with less maritime flair. The New York Stock exchange was founded in 1792, a hundred and ninety years after the Netherlands', and was a primary concern of the early United States. The electrical telegraph helped to consolidate the markets across the blossoming American Nation, and allowed New York and London to blossom as commercial hubs as the Industrial Revolution took shape and hold. Much like the naval ventures of yore, starting a new business and a new industry was a prospect that was almost universally too expensive and too risky for any one businessman, but a board of investors could easily help minimize the risk and maximize the reward."),

		"LOC_PEDIA_UNITS_PAGE_UNIT_LEU_INVESTOR_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_3",					
		"Investment continues to prove a perilous preoccupation, and the modern investor has dozens if not hundreds of examples to fail to learn from. If not careful, investment could lead a person to lose everything, and investors are very seldom careful. However, the great market crashes of 1929, 2008, and 2020 have not discouraged investors from their dangerous gambits and schemes, and it's unlikely that any market crash ever will.");

		"The term tycoon derives from the Japanese word taikun , which means ''great lord'', used as a title for the shogun. The word entered the English language in 1857 with the return of Commodore Perry to the United States. U.S. President Abraham Lincoln was humorously referred to as the Tycoon by his aides John Nicolay and John Hay. The term spread to the business community, where it has been used ever since. The terms mogul, tycoon and baron were often applied to late 19th and early 20th century North American business magnates in extractive industries such as mining, logging and petroleum, transportation fields such as shipping and railroads, manufacturing such as automaking and steelmaking, in banking, as well as newspaper publishing. Their dominance was known as the Second Industrial Revolution, the Gilded Age, or the Robber Baron Era."),

		"During America's Gilded Age — which spanned most of the latter half of the 19th century, from around 1870 to 1900 — the inflation-adjusted wealth and impact of America's most towering figures far overshadowed what we see today."),

		("en_US", 
		"LOC_PEDIA_UNITS_PAGE_UNIT_LEU_TYCOON_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_3",					
		"The wealth of people like John D. Rockefeller, Cornelius Vanderbilt, Henry Ford, and Andrew Carnegie would by today's standards be measured in the hundreds of billions of dollars — far more than tech giants like Elon Musk, Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, and even Jeff Bezos, the wealthiest individual in the world as of 2019. Wealth so vast can often highlight the financial inequality of an era. It's this idea of grandeur in the face of unresolved social concerns that led Mark Twain to coin the phrase “Gilded Age” in his 1873 novel The Gilded Age: A Tale of Today. The title suggested that the thin veneer of wealth for the elite masked broader issues for many in the lower and middle classes."),

		("en_US",

		"But the progress made in the United States during the Gilded Age can't be denied. As part of the Second Industrial Revolution, the country underwent an impressive economic expansion — led by the day's larger-than-life figures of wealth and power. Much of this growth was courtesy of railroads — which now spanned from coast to coast — as well as factories, steel, and the coal mining industry. Big business boomed, with technology such as typewriters, cash registers, and adding machines helping to transform how people worked. And the economic explosion included not only industrial growth, but also a growth in agricultural technology such as mechanical reapers."),

		("en_US", 
		"LOC_PEDIA_UNITS_PAGE_UNIT_LEU_TYCOON_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_5",					
		"In a time of such great expansion and fewer regulations surrounding wealth and business practices, circumstances were perfect for the rise of a class of extremely wealthy individuals who made up a very small percentage of society. They had the power and means to create opportunities and jobs for the many, though with less social prioritization on workers' rights, issues like discrimination, exploitation, and low wages marked the era.");
