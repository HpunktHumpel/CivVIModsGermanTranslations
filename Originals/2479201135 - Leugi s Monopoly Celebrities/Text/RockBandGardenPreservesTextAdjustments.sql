		"An open air concert is a concert taking place outside a hall in the open air. Open air concerts can range from small, acoustic gatherings taking place at a municipal park, to large multi-day music festivals, involving some of the most famous music acts in the world. Often music festivals host other attractions such as food and merchandise vending, dance, crafts, performance art, and social or cultural activities. Many festivals are annual, or repeat at some other interval, while some are held only once. Some festivals are organized as for-profit concerts and others are benefits for a specific charitable cause. The Woodstock Festival in 1969 drew nearly 500,000 attendees, and the Polish spin-off Przystanek Woodstock in 2014 drew 750,000 thus becoming the largest open air annual festival in Europe and the second largest in the world.
