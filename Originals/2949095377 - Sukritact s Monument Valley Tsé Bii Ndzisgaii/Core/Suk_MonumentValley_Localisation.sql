		'Throughout the 19th century, white settlers considered the Monument Valley region to be hostile and ugly. The first U.S. soldiers to explore the area called it “as desolate and repulsive looking a country as can be imagined,”. But the Navajo who called the region Tsé Bii’ Ndzisgaii, or “Clearing Among the Rock”, regarded it as an enormous hogan, or dwelling, with the two isolated stone pinnacles to the north—now known as Gray Whiskers and Sentinel—as its door posts. They considered the two soaring buttes known as the Mittens to be the hands of a deity.'),

		'But Monument Valley’s claim to fame occurred in Hollywood, serving as the backdrop of many movies and television shows, beginning with several John Wayne films including Stagecoach in 1939. The land that was derided by white settlers so long ago, was now internationally recognizable. Under the Navajo Nation’s jurisdiction, Monument Valley became the first-ever tribal park, to be run by Navajo on the national park model, and allocated $275,000 to upgrade roads and build a visitors center. The park is now the most visited corner of the Navajo reservation.');
