		'Kerepakupai Merú is the original indigenous Pemon name for what is better known as Angel Falls. Located in Canaima National Park in Venezuela, Angel Falls is renowned as the tallest uninterrupted waterfall in the world, boasting an impressive height of 979 meters (3,212 feet). Despite the word "Angel" in the name, the falls were not named for anything religious but were instead named for James Angel, an American adventurer who crash-landed his plane on a nearby mesa in 1937, thus becoming the first outsider to discover the falls in the 1930s.'),

		'Though it is one of Venezuela’s top tourist attractions, the trip to the falls is a complicated affair. The falls are located in an isolated jungle. A flight is required to reach Canaima camp, the starting point for river trips to the base of the falls. River trips generally take place from June to December, when the rivers are deep enough for use by the Pemon guides.');
