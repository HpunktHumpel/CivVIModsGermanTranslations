You can shape your relationship with these Wild Animals through different policies and projects that allow you to decide what their purpose will be for your civilization.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Early on, you can decide to hunt them to protect your cities or to earn Bushmeat allowing your cities to get some additional Food, which can be pretty useful to help those places with hunger problems. As the game progresses you can also decide instead to capture them and turn them into Exotic Animals that can be Exhibited at your Entertainment Complexes and Water Parks, allowing your people to gaze at them with admiration and joy, receiving Extra Amenities. Finally, you can also decide to protect the local fauna by building a Preserve or a Garden (if you have that mod) near them, this is specially useful if you want some Faith and Science, and as history progresses to get Diplomatic Favor towards a Diplomatic Victory![NEWLINE][NEWLINE][COLOR:ChatMessage_Help](Original Wildlife Mod by Shirotora and Deliverator, modifications by Leugi)[ENDCOLOR]");
