	'The caballarii of Charlemagne were the military elite that helped to create in Europe first great empire since the Fall of Rome. They were the proto-type for all later Medieval heavy cavalry, eventually evolving into the 10th century milites and eventually the knights of the Middle Ages. In the 11th century chansons of Paladins of Charlemagne we see a French-version of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table. Like the better-known Arthur , these tales have their roots in a much earlier time; when Charlemagne and his caballarii were campaigning from the Danube to the Pyrenees. The legends of Roland/Orlando, Rinaldo, and Ogier the Dane are but the reflections of the true deeds of those Dark Ages elite warriors: the caballarii of Charlemagne!'	),

	'The huscarls (or housecarls) were elite soldiers, first raised as a military force by Canute; he modelled them on the quasi-mythical Scandinavian warrior-brotherhood known as Jomsvikings. Indeed, supposedly the original formation of huscarls were built around a nucleus of Jomsvikings that had come to England under famed Thorkell. Supported by a special tax, Canute maintained three corps (totaling 3000-4000 men), two near London and the third near York. Armed with the usual collection of weapons and armor, the huscarls were especially adept at the shield wall tactic, which demanded both discipline and fortitude. Canute and other Viking rulers usually placed their huscarls in the center of the line to steady the rest of the army, or spread them along the entire front to take the initial enemy assault. Their exploits in battle were the stuff of legend; for instance, the huscarls formed the iron core of Godwinson?s army at Stamford Bridge and at Hastings. After the result of Hastings, however, many huscarls fled to Byzantium, where they would be known as Varangian Guard.'	),

	'The use of mercenaries was quite accepted in the medieval world, and the Muslim, as well as Christian, states employed a wide variety. The Moorish caliphs of Al-Andalus in particular used farfanes - mercenaries from the opposing Iberian Christian kingdoms fighting in European fashion in dense formations, both mounted and afoot. The reasons for these Christian soldiers to fight under the banners of Islam were many. In some cases, as with the famed El Cid, it may have been because they had been banished or exiled from their homelands. Others may have been recent converts to Islam from among conquered peoples, or Christian slaves or prisoners-of-war promised freedom for service. Whatever the reason, the farfanes came to be feared among the many enemies of Moors and were well paid.'	);
