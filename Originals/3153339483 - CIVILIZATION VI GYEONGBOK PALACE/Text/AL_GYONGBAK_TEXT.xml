				<Text>Gyeongbokgung Palace, founded in 1395 during the Joseon Dynasty, holds a significant place in Korean history as the primary royal residence and administrative center. Despite weathering periods of turmoil, such as the Japanese invasions of the late 16th century and the challenges of the colonial era in the early 20th century, Gyeongbokgung Palace remained a beacon of Korean history and culture. In modern times, restoration initiatives were launched, leading to the meticulous reconstruction of some structures, reaffirming the palace's significance as a testament to Korea's enduring legacy.
